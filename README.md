Adds rate my professor ratings to the spire search for classes page. 

Planning on making this into a Chrome Extension, but right now to get it to work:
- Open the Spire Search for Classes page 
- Go into inspect mode by pressing f12 or fn+f12
- On the top of the inspect page it should show some buttons titled:
  - 'Elements' ~Some more here maybe~ '>>' '+'
- Press '>>' and then press 'Sources'
